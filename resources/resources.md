- [Node API Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/): This is the official API documentation for the latest version of Node.js. If you want API documentation for Node 8.x, you go can [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/).
- [Node JavaScript Support](https://node.green/): This site shows a table with the major versions of Node.js and which JavaScript/ES6+ features each supports.
- [ECMAScript Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/): This site shows compatibility of various browsers and platforms with ES5, ES6, and upcoming JavaScript features.
- [Pure Functions](https://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-pure-functions/): An excellent article on the how and why of Pure Functions. Although the article covers the topic from the point of view of Ruby, it is very accessible to JavaScript programmers.
